abstract = {A program is described for drawing the van der Waal's surface of a protein molecule. An extension of the program permits the accessibility of atoms, or groups of atoms, to solvent or solute molecules of specified size to be quantitatively assessed. As defined in this study, the accessibility is proportional to surface area. The accessibility of all atoms in the twenty common amino acids in model tripeptides of the type Ala-X-Ala are given for defined conformation. The accessibilities are also given for all atoms in ribonuclease-S, lysozyme and myogoblin. Internal cavities are defined and discussed. Various summaries of these data are provided. Forty to fifty per cent of the surface area of each protein is occupied by non-polar atoms. The actual numerical results are sensitive to the values chosen for the van der Waal's radii of the various groups. Since there is uncertainty over the correct values for these radii, the derived numbers should only be used as a qualitative guide at this stage. The average change in accessibility for the atoms of all three proteins in going from a hypothetical extended chain to the folded conformation of the native protein is about a factor of 3. This number applies to both polar (nitrogen and oxygen) and non-polar (carbon and sulfur) atoms considered separately. The larger non-polar amino acids tend to be more "buried" in the native form of all three proteins. However, for all classes and for residues within a given class the accessibility changes on folding tend to be highly variable. ?? 1971.},

abstract = {Asymmetric binding of protein homodimers to DNA, which has been observed in a number of protein-DNA complexes, leads to subtle structural differences between the two subunits. Such structural differences are frequently observed when the subunits form cognate and non-cognate protein-DNA complexes, respectively. Analysis of these structural effects on binding specificity should provide insight into the mechanism of protein-DNA recognition. We previously derived empirical potential functions for specific nucleotide base-amino acid interactions from statistical analyses of the structures of many protein-DNA complexes and used a combinatorial threading procedure to evaluate the fitness of the DNA sequences involved. We then introduced Z-scores to measure the specificity with which proteins bind to DNA within complexes, as compared to random DNA sequences. Here, we examined in detail the structural effects of asymmetric and cognate/non-cognate binding on specificity. Marked differences in the specificity of DNA binding were observed for the two subunits of ?? repressor, the glucocorticoid receptor, and for transcription factors containing a Zn2Cys6 binuclear cluster domain, which are known to bind asymmetrically to DNA. Moreover, the differences in the specificity with which Bam H1 and Eco RV endonucleases bind to their cognate and non-cognate DNA sequences were clearly detected using this approach; indeed, analysis of Eco RV binding enabled us to show the cooperative effect of sequence and structure on binding specificity. The present results demonstrate the utility of this approach when examining the structure-specificity relationship in protein-DNA recognition, as subtle structural differences in symmetric/asymmetric and cognate/non-cognate binding were clearly shown to cause marked differences in specificity. This method can also be used as a tool for checking new structures of protein-DNA complexes for their specificity. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Protein-DNA interactions play a central role in transcriptional regulation and other biological processes. Investigating the mechanism of binding affinity and specificity in protein-DNA complexes is thus an important goal. Here we develop a simple physical energy function, which uses electrostatics, solvation, hydrogen bonds and atom-packing terms to model direct readout and sequence-specific DNA conformational energy to model indirect readout of DNA sequence by the bound protein. The predictive capability of the model is tested against another model based only on the knowledge of the consensus sequence and the number of contacts between amino acids and DNA bases. Both models are used to carry out predictions of protein-DNA binding affinities which are then compared with experimental measurements. The nearly additive nature of protein-DNA interaction energies in our model allows us to construct position-specific weight matrices by computing base pair probabilities independently for each position in the binding site. Our approach is less data intensive than knowledge-based models of protein-DNA interactions, and is not limited to any specific family of transcription factors. However, native structures of protein-DNA complexes or their close homologs are required as input to the model. Use of homology modeling can significantly increase the extent of our approach, making it a useful tool for studying regulatory pathways in many organisms and cell types.},

abstract = {This paper considers how enzymes that catalyze reactions at specific DNA sites have been engineered to overcome the problem of competitive inhibition by excess nonspecific binding sites on DNA. The formation of a specific protein-DNA recognition complex is discussed from both structural and thermodynamic perspectives, and contrasted with formation of nonspecific complexes. Evidence (from EcoRI and BamHI endonucleases) is presented that a wide variety of perturbations of the DNA substrate alter binding free energy but do not affect the free energy of activation for the chemical step; that is, many energetic factors contribute equally to the recognition complex and the transition-state complex. This implies that the specific recognition complex bears a close resemblance to the transition-state complex, such that very tight binding to the recognition site on the DNA substrate does not inhibit catalysis, but instead provides energy that is efficiently utilized along the path to the transition state. It is suggested that this view can be usefully extended to "noncatalytic" site-specific DNA-binding proteins like transcriptional activators and general transcription factors.},

The computation is based on the atomic co-ordinates of the protein and on assumptions like those of Lee {\&} Richards (1971). Results for lysozyme and insulin are presented. Changes in exposure to solvent and in the nature of contacts that develop through folding, association reactions and crystallization are described numerically. The computations suggest several generalizations. (a) Lattice contacts within the protein crystal are characterized by a significantly smaller involvement of non-polar side chains and a proportionately greater involvement of ionizable side chains than is found for protein folding or for protein association reactions important for biological function, (b) In helical regions the carbonyl oxygen of the first residue in the helix has high probability of being shielded from solvent, (c) Glycine is among the residues having exposure least affected by folding; this accords with the expectation that it lies at bends of the peptide chain on the surface of the molecule. ?? 1973.},

abstract = {To assess whether there are universal rules that govern amino acid-base recognition, we investigate hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts and water-mediated bonds in 129 protein-DNA complex structures. DNA-backbone interactions are the most numerous, providing stability rather than specificity. For base interactions, there are significant base-amino acid type correlations, which can be rationalised by considering the stereochemistry of protein side chains and the base edges exposed in the DNA structure. Nearly two-thirds of the direct read-out of DNA sequences involves complex networks of hydrogen bonds, which enhance specificity. Two-thirds of all protein-DNA interactions comprise van der Waals contacts, compared to about one-sixth each of hydrogen and water-mediated bonds. This highlights the central importance of these contacts for complex formation, which have previously been relegated to a secondary role. Although common, water-mediated bonds are usually non-specific, acting as space-fillers at the protein-DNA interface. In conclusion, the majority of amino acid-base interactions observed follow general principles that apply across all protein-DNA complexes, although there are individual exceptions. Therefore, we distinguish between interactions whose specificities are 'universal' and 'context-dependent'. An interactive Web-based atlas of side chain-base contacts provides access to the collected data, including analyses and visualisation of the three-dimensional geometry of the interactions.},

In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of protein-nucleic acid recognition and analyze the gene regulation network, not only structural data but also quantitative binding data are necessary. Although there are structural databases for proteins and nucleic acids, there exists no database for their experimental binding data. Thus, we have developed a Thermodynamic Database for Protein-Nucleic Acid Interactions (ProNIT). RESULTS: We have collected experimentally observed binding data from the literature. ProNIT contains several important thermodynamic data for protein-nucleic acid binding, such as dissociation constant (K(d)), association constant (K(a)), Gibbs free energy change (DeltaG), enthalpy change (DeltaH), heat capacity change (DeltaC(p)), experimental conditions, structural information of proteins, nucleic acids and the complex, and literature information. These data are integrated into a relational database system together with structural and functional information to provide flexible searching facilities by using combinations of various terms and parameters. A www interface allows users to search for data based on various conditions, with different display and sorting options, and to visualize molecular structures and their interactions.

abstract = {A detailed analysis of the DNA-binding sites of 26 proteins is presented using data from the Nucleic Acid Database (NDB) and the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Chemical and physical properties of the protein-DNA interface, such as polarity, size, shape, and packing, were analysed. The DNA-binding sites shared common features, comprising many discontinuous sequence segments forming hydrophilic surfaces capable of direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds. These interface sites were compared to those of protein-protein binding sites, revealing them to be more polar, with many more intermolecular hydrogen bonds and buried water molecules than the protein-protein interface sites. By looking at the number and positioning of protein residue-DNA base interactions in a series of interaction footprints, three modes of DNA binding were identified (single-headed, double-headed and enveloping). Six of the eight enzymes in the data set bound in the enveloping mode, with the protein presenting a large interface area effectively wrapped around the DNA.A comparison of structural parameters of the DNA revealed that some values for the bound DNA (including twist, slide and roll) were intermediate of those observed for the unbound B-DNA and A-DNA. The distortion of bound DNA was evaluated by calculating a root-mean-square deviation on fitting to a canonical B-DNA structure. Major distortions were commonly caused by specific kinks in the DNA sequence, some resulting in the overall bending of the helix. The helix bending affected the dimensions of the grooves in the DNA, allowing the binding of protein elements that would otherwise be unable to make contact. From this structural analysis a preliminary set of rules that govern the bending of the DNA in protein-DNA complexes, are proposed.},

abstract = {We analyzed the atomic models of 75 X-ray structures of proteinnucleic acid complexes with the aim of uncovering common properties. The interface area measured the extent of contact between the protein and nucleic acid. It was found to vary between 1120 and 5800 A2. Despite this wide variation, the interfaces in complexes of transcription factors with double-stranded DNA could be broken up into recognition modules where 12 +- 3 nucleotides on the DNA side contact 24 +- 6 amino acids on the protein side, with interface areas in the range 1600 +- 400 A2. For enzymes acting on DNA, the recognition module is on average 600 A2 larger, due to the requirement of making an active site. As judged by its chemical and amino acid composition, the average protein surface in contact with the DNA is more polar than the solvent accessible surface or the typical proteinprotein interface. The protein side is rich in positively charged groups from lysine and arginine side chains; on the DNA side the negative charges from phosphate groups dominate. Hydrogen bonding patterns were also analyzed, and we found one intermolecular hydrogen bond per 125 A2 of interface area in high-resolution structures. An equivalent number of polar interactions involved water molecules, which are generally abundant at proteinDNA interfaces. Calculations of Voronoi atomic volumes, performed in the presence and absence of water molecules, showed that protein atoms buried at the interface with DNA are on average as closely packed as in the protein interior. Water molecules contribute to the close packing, thereby mediating shape complementarity. Finally, conformational changes accompanying association were analyzed in 24 of the complexes for which the structure of the free protein was also available. On the DNA side the extent of deformation showed some correlation with the size of the interface area. On the protein side the type and size of the structural changes spanned a wide spectrum. Disorder-to-order transitions, domain movements, quaternary and tertiary changes were observed, and the largest changes occurred in complexes with large interfaces.},

abstract = {DNA-protein recognition plays a central role in gene expression and regulation. Despite increasing structural data on DNA-protein complexes, the molecular mechanism of DNA-protein recognition is not well understood yet, partly because of the considerable extent of redundancy in the base-amino acid interactions as well as of the structural flexibility present within the same interaction pair. To understand the specificity of such interactions, we should examine the interaction energetics by taking account of the structural flexibility. We describe a strategy for elucidating the specificity of DNA-protein interactions by computer simulation, in which free energies of interactions between the amino acid side chains and base pairs are computed by extensive conformational sampling. The simulations enable us to estimate thermodynamic quantities, such as the interaction free energy, enthalpy, and entropy, for each given position of the CR atom of the amino acid side chain by conformational averaging, and to evaluate the free-energy map around base pairs. We report the results for the interactions of Asn with base pairs. In the case of an A-T base pair, we observed a curved valley-shaped region of free-energy minima on the major-groove side of A. Inspection of global-minimum energy configu- rations of Asn-A interactions in this valley region shows specific double hydrogen bonds, N-H â€šâ€šâ€š N7 and CdO â€šâ€šâ€š HN6, commonly observed in DNA-protein complex structures. On the other hand, we also observed other kinds of double and single hydrogen bonds depending on the CR position in this valley region. Furthermore, the Asn side chain at various positions of CR is flexible enough to readjust its conformation to form similar interactions with the base pair. These results demonstrate the importance of structural flexibility for the specific interactions involved. The free-energy map shows subtle differences from the interaction energy map, revealing the role of entropy in the specificity. The comparison of the free-energy maps for G-C and A-T revealed significant differences in their patterns. These results suggest that our method can be used to dissect the mechanism of base discrimination by amino acids.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The specific recognition of genomic cis-regulatory elements by transcription factors (TFs) plays an essential role in the regulation of coordinated gene expression. Studying the mechanisms determining binding specificity in protein-DNA interactions is thus an important goal. Most current approaches for modeling TF specific recognition rely on the knowledge of large sets of cognate target sites and consider only the information contained in their primary sequence. RESULTS: Here we describe a structure-based methodology for predicting sequence motifs starting from the coordinates of a TF-DNA complex. Our algorithm combines information regarding the direct and indirect readout of DNA into an atomistic statistical model, which is used to estimate the interaction potential. We first measure the ability of our method to correctly estimate the binding specificities of eight prokaryotic and eukaryotic TFs that belong to different structural superfamilies. Secondly, the method is applied to two homology models, finding that sampling of interface side-chain rotamers remarkably improves the results. Thirdly, the algorithm is compared with a reference structural method based on contact counts, obtaining comparable predictions for the experimental complexes and more accurate sequence motifs for the homology models. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that atomic-detail structural information can be feasibly used to predict TF binding sites. The computational method presented here is universal and might be applied to other systems involving protein-DNA recognition.},

abstract = {Empirical or knowledge-based potentials have many applications in structural biology such as the prediction of protein structure, protein-protein, and protein-ligand interactions and in the evaluation of stability for mutant proteins, the assessment of errors in experimentally solved structures, and the design of new proteins. Here, we describe a simple procedure to derive and use pairwise distance-dependent potentials that rely on the definition of effective atomic interactions, which attempt to capture interactions that are more likely to be physically relevant. Based on a difficult benchmark test composed of proteins with different secondary structure composition and representing many different folds, we show that the use of effective atomic interactions significantly improves the performance of potentials at discriminating between native and near-native conformations. We also found that, in agreement with previous reports, the potentials derived from the observed effective atomic interactions in native protein structures contain a larger amount of mutual information. A detailed analysis of the effective energy functions shows that atom connectivity effects, which mostly arise when deriving the potential by the incorporation of those indirect atomic interactions occurring beyond the first atomic shell, are clearly filtered out. The shape of the energy functions for direct atomic interactions representing hydrogen bonding and disulfide and salt bridges formation is almost unaffected when effective interactions are taken into account. On the contrary, the shape of the energy functions for indirect atom interactions (i.e., those describing the interaction between two atoms bound to a direct interacting pair) is clearly different when effective interactions are considered. Effective energy functions for indirect interacting atom pairs are not influenced by the shape or the energy minimum observed for the corresponding direct interacting atom pair. Our results suggest that the dependency between the signals in different energy functions is a key aspect that need to be addressed when empirical energy functions are derived and used, and also highlight the importance of additivity assumptions in the use of potential energy functions.},

abstract = {We present a new approach at the atomic level for the development of knowledge-based mean force potentials (MFPs) that can be used in fold recognition, ab initio structure prediction, comparative modelling and molecular recognition. Our method is based on atom-type definitions, raising the total frequency of the pairwise distributions and leading to very accurate and specific distance-dependent energy functions. Forty different heavy atom types were defined depending on their bond connectivity, chemical nature and location level (side-chain or backbone). Using this approach it has been possible to obtain average frequencies of pairwise contacts about 15 times higher than the ones obtained using the classic way of one heavy atom definition for each amino acid (i.e. alpha-carbon, beta-carbon, virtual centroid or virtual beta-carbon co-ordinates). In this paper we use this approach to develop a MFP that can be used in fold recognition and we compare it with a classic MFP at the amino acid level compiled from the alpha-carbon distances between the different amino acid pairs. Both potentials involve all the pairwise contacts extracted from a non-redundant folds database of 180 protein chains with a sequence identity threshold of 25{\%}. The pairwise energy functions of the MFP at the atomic level have a deep and very well defined minimum for each pairwise interaction, in contrast to the same curves obtained from the MFP developed at the amino acid level, which generally have multiple minima with similar depth. Our results also show that this MFP is able to produce very similar energy profiles for couples of proteins that share a very low sequence identity but are closely related at the structural level. When these profiles are plotted considering the structure-structure alignment, they are mostly superimposed, showing a correlation with the structure-structure similarity. In the same test, the MFP at the amino acid level fails to produce similar profiles. We suggest that using this MFP at the atomic level in the last stages of fold recognition or threading, when some candidates are available, can improve the sequence-structure alignments and, therefore, the final models. We also discuss the possibility of using this approach in the development of new MFPs to be used in ab initio structure prediction, comparative modelling and molecular recognition procedures.},

abstract = {Computational evaluation of protein-DNA interaction is important for the identification of DNA-binding sites and genome annotation. It could validate the predicted binding motifs by sequence-based approaches through the calculation of the binding affinity between a protein and DNA. Such an evaluation should take into account structural information to deal with the complicated effects from DNA structural deformation, distance-dependent multi-body interactions and solvation contributions. In this paper, we present a knowledge-based potential built on interactions between protein residues and DNA tri-nucleotides. The potential, which explicitly considers the distance-dependent two-body, three-body and four-body interactions between protein residues and DNA nucleotides, has been optimized in terms of a Z-score. We have applied this knowledge-based potential to evaluate the binding affinities of zinc-finger protein-DNA complexes. The predicted binding affinities are in good agreement with the experimental data (with a correlation coefficient of 0.950). On a larger test set containing 48 protein-DNA complexes with known experimental binding free energies, our potential has achieved a high correlation coefficient of 0.800, when compared with the experimental data. We have also used this potential to identify binding motifs in DNA sequences of transcription factors (TF). The TFs in 79.4{\%} of the known TF-DNA complexes have accurately found their native binding sequences from a large pool of DNA sequences. When tested in a genome-scale search for TF-binding motifs of the cyclic AMP regulatory protein (CRP) of Escherichia coli, this potential ranks all known binding motifs of CRP in the top 15{\%} of all candidate sequences.},

abstract = {We consider the identification of interacting protein-nucleic acid partners using the rigid body docking method FTdock, which is systematic and exhaustive in the exploration of docking conformations. The accuracy of rigid body docking methods is tested using known protein-DNA complexes for which the docked and undocked structures are both available. Additional tests with large decoy sets probe the efficacy of two published statistically derived scoring functions that contain a huge number of parameters. In contrast, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art machine learning techniques can enormously reduce the number of parameters required, thereby identifying the relevant docking features using a miniscule fraction of the number of parameters in the prior works. The present machine learning study considers a 300 dimensional vector (dependent on only 15 parameters), termed the Chemical Context Profile (CCP), where each dimension reflects a specific type of protein amino acid-nucleic acid base interaction. The CCP is designed to capture the chemical complementarities of the interface and is well suited for machine learning techniques. Our objective function is the Chemical Context Discrepancy (CCD), which is defined as the angle between the native system's CCP vector and the decoy's vector and which serves as a substitute for the more commonly used root mean squared deviation (RMSD). We demonstrate that the CCP provides a useful scoring function when certain dimensions are properly weighted. Finally, we explore how the amino acids on a protein's surface can help guide DNA binding, first through long-range interactions, followed by direct contacts, according to specific preferences for either the major or minor grooves of the DNA.},

abstract = {Motivation: Over the recent years, the vision that RNA simply serves as information transfer molecule has dramatically changed. The study of the sequence/structure/function relationships in RNA is becoming more important. As a direct consequence, the total number of experimentally solved RNA structures has dramatically increased and new computer tools for predicting RNA structure from sequence are rapidly emerging. Therefore, new and accurate methods for assessing the accuracy of RNA structure models are clearly needed. Results: Here, we introduce an all-atom knowledge-based potential for the assessment of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures. We have benchmarked our new potential, called Ribonucleic Acids Statistical Potential (RASP), with two different decoy datasets composed of near-native RNA structures. In one of the benchmark sets, RASP was able to rank the closest model to the X-ray structure as the best and within the top 10 models for âˆ¼93 and âˆ¼95{\%} of decoys, respectively. The average correlation coefficient between model accuracy, calculated as the root mean square deviation and global distance test-total score (GDT-TS) measures of C3â€² atoms, and the RASP score was 0.85 and 0.89, respectively. Based on a recently released benchmark dataset that contains hundreds of 3D models for 32 RNA motifs with non-canonical base pairs, RASP scoring function compared favorably to ROSETTA FARFAR force field in the selection of accurate models. Finally, using the self-splicing group I intron and the stem-loop IIIc from hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry site as test cases, we show that RASP is able to discriminate between known structure-destabilizing mutations and compensatory mutations. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011.

abstract = {Structural studies of protein-DNA complexes have shown that there are many distinct families of DNA-binding proteins, and have shown that there is no simple "code" describing side-chain/base interactions. However, systematic analysis and comparison of protein-DNA complexes has been complicated by the diversity of observed contacts, the sheer number of complexes currently available and the absence of any consistent method of comparison that retains detailed structural information about the protein-DNA interface. To address these problems, we have developed geometric methods for characterizing the local structural environment in which particular side-chain/base interactions are observed. In particular, we develop methods for analyzing and comparing spatial relationships at the protein-DNA interface. Our method involves attaching local coordinate systems to the DNA bases and to the C(alpha) atoms of the peptide backbone (these are relatively rigid structural units). We use these tools to consider how the position and orientation of the polypeptide backbone (with respect to the DNA) helps to determine what contacts are possible at any given position in a protein-DNA complex. Here, we focus on base contacts that are made in the major groove, and we use spatial relationships in analyzing: (i) the observed patterns of side-chain/base interactions; (ii) observed helix docking orientations; (iii) family/subfamily relationships among DNA-binding proteins; and (iv) broader questions about evolution, altered specificity mutants and the limits for the design of new DNA-binding proteins. Our analysis, which highlights differences in spatial relationships in different complexes and at different positions in a complex, helps explain why there is no simple, general code for protein-DNA recognition.},

We focus on the indirect readout mechanism and discuss its theoretical description in relation to the present understanding of DNA elasticity on the rigid base pair level. Combining existing parametrizations of elastic potentials for DNA, we derive elastic free energies directly related to competitive binding experiments, and propose a computationally inexpensive local marker for elastically optimized subsequences in protein-DNA co-crystals. We test our approach in an application to the bacteriophage 434 repressor. In agreement with known results we find that indirect readout dominates at the central, non-contacted bases of the binding site. Elastic optimization involves all deformation modes and is mainly due to the adapted equilibrium structure of the operator, while sequence-dependent elasticity plays a minor role. These qualitative observations are robust with respect to current parametrization uncertainties. Predictions for relative affinities mediated by indirect readout depend sensitively on the chosen parametrization. Their quantitative comparison with experimental data allows for a critical evaluation of DNA elastic potentials and of the correspondence between crystal and solution structures.

abstract = {We present a prototype of a new approach to the folding problem of polypeptide chains. This apprach is based on the analysis of known protein structures. It derives the energy potentials for the atomic interactions of all amino acid residue pairs as a function of the distance between the involved atoms. These potentials are then used to calculate the energies of all conformations that exist in the data base with respect to a given sequence. Then, by using only the most stable conformations, clusters of the most probable conformations for the given sequence are obtained. To discuss the results properly we introduce a new classification of segments based on their conformational stability. Special care is taken to allow for sparse data sets. The use of the method is demonstrated in the discussion of the identical oligopeptide sequences found in different conformations in unrelated proteins. VNTFV, for example, adopts a ??-strand in ribonuclease but it is found in an ??-helical conformation in erythrocruorin. In the case of VNTFV the ensemble obtained consists of a single cluster of ??-strand conformations, indicating that this may be the preferred conformation for the pentapeptide. When the flanking residues are included in the calculation the hepapeptide P-VNTFV-H (ribonuclease) again yields an ensemble of ??-strands. However, in the ensemble of D-VNTFV-A (erythrocruorin) the major cluster is of ??-helical type. In the present study we concentrate on the local aspects of protein conformations. However, the theory presented is quite general and not restricted to oligopeptides. We indicate extentions of the approach to the calculation of global conformations of proteins as well as conceivable applications to a number of molecular systems. ?? 1990 Academic Press Limited.},

The APC35832 protein is a representative of large group of bacterial and archeal proteins entirely consisting of the Toprim (topoisomerase-primase) domain. This domain is found in the catalytic centers of many enzymes catalyzing phosphodiester bond formation or cleavage, but the function of small Toprim domain proteins remains unknown. Consistent with the sequence analysis, the APC35832 structure shows a conserved Toprim fold, with a central 4-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by four alpha-helixes. Comparison of the APC35832 structure with its closest structural homolog, the catalytic core of bacteriophage T7 primase, revealed structural conservation of a metal binding site and isothermal titration calorimetry indicates that APC35832 binds Mg2+ with a sub-millimolar dissociation constant (K(d)). The APC35832-Mg2+ complex structure was determined at 1.65 A and reveals the role of conserved acidic residues in Mg2+ ion coordination.

abstract = {Elastic ellipsoidal functions defined by the observed hydration patterns around the DNA bases provide a new basis for measuring the recognition of ligands in the grooves of double-helical structures. Here a set of knowledge-based potentials suitable for quantitative description of such behavior is extracted from the observed positions of water molecules and amino acid atoms that form hydrogen bonds with the nitrogenous bases in high resolution crystal structures. Energies based on the displacement of hydrogen-bonding sites on drugs in DNA-crystal complexes relative to the preferred locations of water binding around the heterocyclic bases are low, pointing to the reliability of the potentials and the apparent displacement of water molecules by drug atoms in these structures. The validity of the energy functions has been further examined in a series of sequence substitution studies based on the structures of DNA bound to polyamides that have been designed to recognize the minor-groove edges of Watson-Crick basepairs. The higher energies of binding to incorrect sequences superimposed (without conformational adjustment or displacement of polyamide ligands) on observed high resolution structures confirm the hypothesis that the drug subunits associate with specific DNA bases. The knowledge-based functions also account satisfactorily for the measured free energies of DNA-polyamide association in solution and the observed sites of polyamide binding on nucleosomal DNA. The computations are generally consistent with mechanisms by which minor-groove binding ligands are thought to recognize DNA basepairs. The calculations suggest that the asymmetric distributions of hydrogen-bond-forming atoms on the minor-groove edge of the basepairs may underlie ligand discrimination of G.C from C.G pairs, in addition to the commonly believed role of steric hindrance. The analysis of polyamide-bound nucleosomal structures reveals other discrepancies in the expected chemical design, including unexpected contacts to DNA and modified basepair targets of some ligands. The ellipsoidal potentials thus appear promising as a mathematical tool for the study of drug- and protein-DNA interactions and for gaining new insights into DNA-binding mechanisms.},

abstract = {A new method is introduced to structurally align interfaces observed in protein-DNA complexes. The method is based on a procedure that describes the interfacial geometry in terms of the spatial relationships between individual amino acid-nucleotide pairs. An amino acid-amino acid similarity matrix, S, is defined that provides a quantitative measure of the geometric relationships of amino acids in different interfaces and the entire stretch of "local" DNA within some distance of each amino acid. S is used as a substitution matrix in a dynamic programming algorithm that aligns the interfacial amino acids of the two complexes. The quality of the alignment is determined by an interface alignment score, IAS, that provides a quantitative measure of the similarity in the docking geometry between two protein-DNA complexes. We have clustered a large set of protein-DNA complexes based on their IAS values. In general, proteins within a single family form identifiable clusters. Subgroup clustering is often observed within families offering a fine-grained description of docking geometries. Although proteins with similar folds tend to dock in similar ways, important differences are observed even for structural motifs that almost perfectly align. Relationships are observed between the interfaces formed in cognate and non-cognate complexes involving the same proteins indicating a strong driving force to maintain certain contacts, even if this requires a distortion of the DNA. There are cases where inter-family similarities are greater than intra-family similarities. Our method offers the possibility of comparing different protein-DNA interfaces in a detailed, objective and quantitative fashion. This offers the possibility of new approaches to the description of the determinants of molecular recognition and to the prediction of protein and DNA sequence combinations that are optimal for binding. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A comprehensive analysis of interfacial water molecules in the structures of 109 unique protein-DNA complexes is presented together with a new view on their role in protein-DNA recognition. Location of interfacial water molecules as reported in the crystal structures and as emerging from a series of molecular dynamics studies on protein-DNA complexes with explicit solvent and counterions, was analyzed based on their acceptor, donor hydrogen bond relationships with the atoms and residues of the macromolecules, electrostatic field calculations and packing density considerations. Water molecules for the purpose of this study have been categorized into four classes: viz. (I) those that contact both the protein and the DNA simultaneously and thus mediate recognition directly; (II) those that contact either the protein or the DNA exclusively via hydrogen bonds solvating each solute separately; (III) those that contact the hydrophobic groups in either the protein or the DNA; and, lastly (IV) those that contact another water molecule. Of the 17,963 crystallographic water molecules under examination, about 6 {\%} belong to class I and 76 {\%} belong to class II. About three-fourths of class I and class II water molecules are exclusively associated with hydrogen bond acceptor atoms of both protein and DNA. Noting that DNA is polyanionic, it is significant that a majority of the crystallographically observed water molecules as well as those from molecular dynamics simulations should be involved in facilitating binding by screening unfavorable electrostatics. Less than 2 {\%} of the reported water molecules occur between hydrogen bond donor atoms of protein and acceptor atoms of DNA. These represent cases where protein atoms cannot reach out to DNA to make favorable hydrogen bond interactions due to packing/structural restrictions and interfacial water molecules provide an extension to side-chains to accomplish hydrogen bonding.},

The correlation coefficients between experimentally measured protein-ligand binding affinities and those predicted by the DFIRE energy function are around 0.63 for one training set and two testing sets. The energy function also makes highly accurate predictions of binding affinities of protein-protein and protein-DNA complexes. Correlation coefficients between theoretical and experimental results are 0.73 for 82 protein-protein (peptide) complexes and 0.83 for 45 protein-DNA complexes, despite the fact that the structures of protein-protein (peptide) and protein-DNA complexes were not used in training the energy function. The results of the DFIRE energy function on protein-ligand complexes are compared to the published results of 12 other scoring functions generated from either physical-based, knowledge-based, or empirical methods. They include AutoDock, X-Score, DrugScore, four scoring functions in Cerius 2 (LigScore, PLP, PMF, and LUDI), four scoring functions in SYBYL (F-Score, G-Score, D-Score, and ChemScore), and BLEEP. While the DFIRE energy function is only moderately successful in ranking native or near native conformations, it yields the strongest correlation between theoretical and experimental binding affinities of the testing sets and between rmsd values and energy scores of docking decoys in a benchmark of 100 protein-ligand complexes.

Earlier studies have been confined to antibodies specific for small molecules (haptens) rather than for proteins. We compare the structures of four antibodies bound to the same site on hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) at different stages of affinity maturation. These X-ray snapshots reveal that binding is enhanced, not through the formation of additional hydrogen bonds or van der Waals contacts or by an increase in total buried surface, but by burial of increasing amounts of apolar surface at the expense of polar surface, accompanied by improved shape complementarity. The increase in hydrophobic interactions results from highly correlated rearrangements in antibody residues at the interface periphery, adjacent to the central energetic hot spot. This first visualization of the maturation of antibodies to protein provides insights into the evolution of high affinity in other proteinâˆ’protein interfaces.},

abstract = {The accurate assessment of structural errors plays a key role in protein structure prediction, constitutes the first step of protein structure refinement, and has a major impact on subsequent functional inference from structural data. In this study, we assess and compare the ability of different full atom knowledge-based potentials to detect small and localized errors in comparative protein structure models of known accuracy. We have evaluated the effect of incorporating close nonbonded pairwise atom terms on the task of classifying residue modeling accuracy. Since the direct and unbiased derivation of close nonbonded terms from current experimental data is not possible, we extrapolated those terms from the corresponding pseudo-energy functions of a nonlocal knowledge-based potential. It is shown that this methodology clearly improves the detection of errors in protein models, suggesting that a proper description of close nonbonded terms is important to achieve a more complete and accurate description of native protein conformations. The use of close nonbonded terms directly derived from experimental data exhibited a poor performance, demonstrating that these terms cannot be accurately obtained by using the current data and methodology. Some external knowledge-based energy functions that are widely used in model assessment also performed poorly, which suggests that the benchmark of models and the specific error detection task tested in this study constituted a difficult challenge. The methodology presented here could be useful to detect localized structural errors not only in high-quality protein models, but also in experimental protein structures.},

abstract = {Protein-DNA interactions play a central role in regulatory processes at the genetic level. DNA-binding proteins recognize their targets by direct base-amino acid interactions and indirect conformational energy contribution from DNA deformations and elasticity. Knowledge-based approach based on the statistical analysis of protein-DNA complex structures has been successfully used to calculate interaction energies and specificities of direct and indirect readouts in protein-DNA recognition. Here, we have implemented the method as a webserver, which calculates direct and indirect readout energies and Z-scores, as a measure of specificity, using atomic coordinates of protein-DNA complexes. This server is freely available at http://gibk26.bse.kyutech.ac.jp/jouhou/readout/. The only input to this webserver is the Protein Data Bank (PDB) style coordinate data of atoms or the PDB code itself. The server returns total energy Z-scores, which estimate the degree of sequence specificity of the protein-DNA complex. This webserver is expected to be useful for estimating interaction energy and DNA conformation energy, and relative contributions to the specificity from direct and indirect readout. It may also be useful for checking the quality of protein-DNA complex structures, and for engineering proteins and target DNAs.},

@article{Melo1998,
abstract = {We describe a new approach, based on the energy of non-local interactions, to assess protein structures. The method uses a very sensitive and accurate atomic mean force potential (AMFP) to calculate the non-local energy profile (NL-profile) of a proteins structure. Several protein models, built using the comparative modeling technique and containing several errors, were evaluated. These models exhibit a good stereochemistry and have been previously checked with different, widely used, methods that failed to detect the errors. The AMFP-derived energy profiles are able to correlate high scores with point errors and misalignments in the models. The point errors are frequently found in loops or regions of structural differences between the template and the target protein. The misalignments are clearly detected with very high scores. The performance of the method was also tested for the assessment of X-ray solved protein structures. In a data set of 143 well solved and non-redundant protein structures, we find that the average energy Z-scores, obtained from AMFP, increase as the resolution decreases. In the case of structures that have already been described as having an unusual stereochemistry, very high Z-scores are obtained. Moreover, energy calculations for some pairs of obsolete and replacement proteins always show higher Z-scores for the obsolete proteins. Finally, two particular cases show the usefulness of the profiles in the assessment of X-ray solved protein structures. First, the NL-profile of a protein structure refined in the incorrect space group has very high scores in several regions. One region has already been described to be out-of-register with the density map of the structure. The NL-profile of the re-refined structure with the correct space group is vastly improved. In the second case, the method is able to accurately point out disordered residues, even if the atoms of these residues do not violate the sum of the van der Waals radii. ANOLEA, the program used to calculate the NL-profile of a protein structure containing one or more chains is accessible through the World Wide Web at: http://www.fundp.ac.be/pub/ANOLEA.html.},

abstract = {The utility of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to model biomolecular structure, dynamics, and interactions has witnessed enormous advances in recent years due to the availability of optimized MD software and access to significant computational power, including GPU multicore computing engines and other specialized hardware. This has led researchers to routinely extend conformational sampling times to the microsecond level and beyond. The extended sampling time has allowed the community not only to converge conformational ensembles through complete sampling but also to discover deficiencies and overcome problems with the force fields. Accuracy of the force fields is a key component, along with sampling, toward being able to generate accurate and stable structures of biopolymers. The Amber force field for nucleic acids has been used extensively since the 1990s, and multiple artifacts have been discovered, corrected, and reassessed by different research groups. We present a direct comparison of two of the most recent and state-of-the-art Amber force field modifications, bsc1 and OL15, that focus on accurate modeling of double-stranded DNA. After extensive MD simulations with five test cases and two different water models, we conclude that both modifications are a remarkable improvement over the previous bsc0 force field. Both force field modifications show better agreement when compared to experimental structures. To ensure convergence, the Drewâ€“Dickerson dodecamer (DDD) system was simulated using 100 independent MD simulations, each extended to at least 10 $\mu$s, and the independent MD simulations were concatenated into a single 1 ms long trajectory for each combination of force field and water model. This is significantly beyond the time scale needed to converge the conformational ensemble of the internal portions of a DNA helix absent internal base pair opening. Considering all of the simulations discussed in the current work, the MD simulations performed to assess and validate the current force fields and water models aggregate over 14 ms of simulation time. The results suggest that both the bsc1 and OL15 force fields render average structures that deviate significantly less than 1 {\AA} from the average experimental structures. This can be compared to similar but less exhaustive simulations with the CHARMM 36 force field that aggregate to the âˆ¼90 $\mu$s time scale and also perform well but do not produce structures as close to the DDD NMR average structures (with root-mean-square deviations of 1.3 {\AA}) as the newer Amber force fields. On the basis of these analyses, any future research involving double-stranded DNA simulations using the Amber force fields should employ the bsc1 or OL15 modification.},

abstract = {We describe a comparative protein modelling method designed to find the most probable structure for a sequence given its alignment with related structures. The three-dimensional (3D) model is obtained by optimally satisfying spatial restraints derived from the alignment and expressed as probability density functions (pdfs) for the features restrained. For example, the probabilities for main-chain conformations of a modelled residue may be restrained by its residue type, main-chain conformation of an equivalent residue in a related protein, and the local similarity between the two sequences. Several such pdfs are obtained from the correlations between structural features in 17 families of homologous proteins which have been aligned on the basis of their 3D structures. The pdfs restrain C alpha-C alpha distances, main-chain N-O distances, main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles. A smoothing procedure is used in the derivation of these relationships to minimize the problem of a sparse database. The 3D model of a protein is obtained by optimization of the molecular pdf such that the model violates the input restraints as little as possible. The molecular pdf is derived as a combination of pdfs restraining individual spatial features of the whole molecule. The optimization procedure is a variable target function method that applies the conjugate gradients algorithm to positions of all non-hydrogen atoms. The method is automated and is illustrated by the modelling of trypsin from two other serine proteinases.},

abstract = {The deformability of double helical DNA is critical for its packaging in the cell, recognition by other molecules, and transient opening during biochemically important processes. Here, a complete set of sequence-dependent empirical energy functions suitable for describing such behavior is extracted from the fluctuations and correlations of structural parameters in DNA-protein crystal complexes. These elastic functions provide useful stereochemical measures of the local base step movements operative in sequence-specific recognition and protein-induced deformations. In particular, the pyrimidine-purine dimers stand out as the most variable steps in the DNA-protein complexes, apparently acting as flexible "hinges" fitting the duplex to the protein surface. In addition to the angular parameters widely used to describe DNA deformations (i.e., the bend and twist angles), the translational parameters describing the displacements of base pairs along and across the helical axis are analyzed. The observed correlations of base pair bending and shearing motions are important for nonplanar folding of DNA in nucleosomes and other nucleoprotein complexes. The knowledge-based energies also offer realistic three-dimensional models for the study of long DNA polymers at the global level, incorporating structural features beyond the scope of conventional elastic rod treatments and adding a new dimension to literal analyses of genomic sequences.},

IHF is known to exhibit both direct and in- direct recognition of its binding sites. (1) Threading DNA sequences onto the crystal structure showed statistically significant partial separation of 60 IHF binding sites from random and intragenic sequences and was positively cor- related with binding affinity. (2) The crystal structure was shown to be equivalent to a linear Markov network, and so, to a joint probability distribution over sequences, com- putable in linear time. It was transformed algorithmically into several common pure-sequence representations, in- cluding (a) small sets of short exact strings, (b) weight matrices, (c) consensus regular patterns, (d) multiple se- quence alignments, and (e) phylogenetic trees. In all cases the pure-sequence motifs retained statistically significant partial separation of the IHF binding sites from random and intragenic sequences. Most exhibited positive corre- lation with binding affinity. The multiple alignment showed some conserved columns, and the phylogenetic tree par- tially mixed low-energy sequences with IHF binding sites but separated high-energy sequences. The conclusion is that deformation energy explains part of indirect recogni- tion, which explains part of IHF sequence-specific binding},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge of transcription factor-DNA binding patterns is crucial for understanding gene transcription. Numerous DNA-binding proteins are annotated as transcription factors in the literature, however, for many of them the corresponding DNA-binding motifs remain uncharacterized. RESULTS: The position weight matrices (PWMs) of transcription factors from different structural classes have been determined using a knowledge-based statistical potential. The scoring function calibrated against crystallographic data on protein-DNA contacts recovered PWMs of various members of widely studied transcription factor families such as p53 and NF-kappaB. Where it was possible, extensive comparison to experimental binding affinity data and other physical models was made. Although the p50p50, p50RelB, and p50p65 dimers belong to the same family, particular differences in their PWMs were detected, thereby suggesting possibly different in vivo binding modes. The PWMs of p63 and p73 were computed on the basis of homology modeling and their performance was studied using upstream sequences of 85 p53/p73-regulated human genes. Interestingly, about half of the p63 and p73 hits reported by the Match algorithm in the altogether 126 promoters lay more than 2 kb upstream of the corresponding transcription start sites, which deviates from the common assumption that most regulatory sites are located more proximal to the TSS. The fact that in most of the cases the binding sites of p63 and p73 did not overlap with the p53 sites suggests that p63 and p73 could influence the p53 transcriptional activity cooperatively. The newly computed p50p50 PWM recovered 5 more experimental binding sites than the corresponding TRANSFAC matrix, while both PWMs showed comparable receiver operator characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: A novel algorithm was developed to calculate position weight matrices from protein-DNA complex structures. The proposed algorithm was extensively validated against experimental data. The method was further combined with Homology Modeling to obtain PWMs of factors for which crystallographic complexes with DNA are not yet available. The performance of PWMs obtained in this work in comparison to traditionally constructed matrices demonstrates that the structure-based approach presents a promising alternative to experimental determination of transcription factor binding properties.},
