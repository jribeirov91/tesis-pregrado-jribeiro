This bibliography style file is intended for texts in ENGLISH
This is a numerical citation style, and as such is standard LaTeX.
It requires no extra package to interface to the main text.
The form of the \bibitem entries is
  \bibitem{key}...
Usage of \cite is as follows:
  \cite{key} ==>>          [#]
  \cite[chap. 2]{key} ==>> [#, chap. 2]
where # is a number determined by the ordering in the reference list.
The order in the reference list is that by which the works were originally
  cited in the text, or that in the database.

To change the reference numbering system from [1] to 1,
put the following code in the preamble:
\makeatletter % Reference list option change
\renewcommand\@biblabel[1]{#1} % from [1] to 1
\makeatother %
